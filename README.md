# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

# push-donut-project
A testnet dApp built on Push Chain's Donut Testnet using the Push SDK. It demonstrates universal contract deployment with Hardhat and integrates the UniversalCounter smart contract. The project highlights smooth transaction execution, SDK integration, and serves as a learning tool for Push-based development.
